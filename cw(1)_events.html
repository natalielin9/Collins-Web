			This has a description of the events. Then has a table with the events that
			are occuring within the next 2 weeks. This site is not fully running yet, so 
			the events are fake events and the date is simply set to June 1, 2024 as that 
			was a date I picked looking ahead to a time this site may possibly be truly released
			(a mobile app is being developed and marketing and advertisement still needs to be done).
